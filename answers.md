#Find and example of when this strcutre does not work well. How can you improve it?
This structure doesn't work well when you ask something like, "You don't hate me" (Resposnse = "What do I don't hate you"). A way to improve this would be to have it look for negative statements as well and respond to negatives with either "Why so negative" or "Why don't I hate you".
