##Activity 1

#Exploration:
#How does it respond to "where do you come from"?
Most of my parts can be bought at better-stocked hardware stores and assembled by a typical high-school student.


#What is the most interesting response?
I learn from user inputs like yours.


#What is the most peculiar response?
How smart am I? I can't tell


#How does it respond to "asdfjkl;"?
What?! That doesn't make sense!

#Questions:
#Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds?
    - Question words like how, why, who, what, etc.
    - Nubmber/words identifiers like "many" or "name"

#Think of several keywords and the resposes they might cause.
    - Many and name
    - "About 46" or "his name is Bill".

##Activity 2
#What happends when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the responses to these statements. 
    - The program defaults to the last mentioned keyword and uses the stored response for only that keyword.

##Activity 3

#What value is returned if the substring does not occur in the string?
The index of the string of first occurance is returned.
